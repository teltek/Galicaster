;; MATTERHORN SERIES
;; This section sets allows filtering series shown in the drop down list of the metadata editor.
;; It accepts most of the filter values that Matterhorn endpoint accepts, namely:
;;    seriesId, seriesTitle, creator, contributor, publisher, rightsholder, createdfrom, 
;;    createdto, language, license, subject, abstract, description
;; According to Matterhorn documentation, the date-like filters (createdfrom and createdto) must 
;; follow the format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'
;; In addition to the previous filters, the 'default' keyword accepts a series ID that will appear
;; in the series list, no matter what.
;; The values to the parameters may include placeholders for certain environment variables.
;; The only one supported currently is '{user}', that is substituted with the current user name.
