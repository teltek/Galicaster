Caps
----

V4L2 devices accepts two types of signal inputs - RAW and MJPEG - and multiple resolution-framerate combinations. A simplified Gstreamer cappabilities string is formed by type, resolution and framerate among other parameters:

    Type: image/jpeg or video/x-raw-yuv
    Framerate: X/Y. Examples: 30/1, 25/1, 24/1, 10/1
    Resolution: width=A,height=B. A and B being length in pixels

Them, a complete caps string looks like:

image/jpeg, framerate=24/1, width=1280, height=720
video/x-raw-yuv framerate=30/1, width=1280, height=1024

Examples:
---------

--Logitech c920

[track1]
name = Webcam
device = v4l2
location = /dev/webcam
file = WEBCAM.avi
flavor = presenter
caps = image/jpeg,framerate=24/1,width=1280,height=720
videocrop-left = 160
videocrop-right = 160
